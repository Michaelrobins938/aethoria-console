### Environment Variables
Your `.env.local` file already contains the necessary API keys:

```

### API Endpoint
The chat interface uses your existing `/api/chat/route.ts` endpoint, which:

2. **Streaming Issues**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify API endpoint is working

3. **Styling Issues**

```
