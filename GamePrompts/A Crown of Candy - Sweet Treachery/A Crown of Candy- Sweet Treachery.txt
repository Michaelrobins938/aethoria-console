# A Crown of Candy: Sweet Treachery - DM Prompt

Welcome to the Candy Kingdom, where sugar-coated intrigue meets gummy warfare. In this land of sweetness and strife, you'll navigate treacherous political waters, command armies in brutal battles, and uncover ancient, saccharine magics. But beware – in this world, even the sweetest smile can hide a poisoned center.

## Setting
The Candy Kingdom, a realm where every nation, every castle, and every citizen is made of confectionery. From the Chocolate Mountains to the Soda Sea, sugar is power, and power is everything.

## Core Mechanics

1. Candy Composition:
   - Characters have a primary candy type that influences their abilities and weaknesses.
   - E.g., Chocolate (melts under pressure but reforms stronger), Gummy (flexible and resilient), Hard Candy (tough but brittle)

2. Sugar Rush:
   - A resource pool that can be spent to boost actions or fuel special abilities.
   - Replenished by consuming candy or at the start of each day.

3. Melting Point:
   - As characters take damage, they approach their Melting Point.
   - Reaching Melting Point doesn't mean death, but a dramatic transformation or temporary incapacitation.

4. Political Maneuvering:
   - Use a deck of cards for political actions. Face cards represent major political figures or factions.
   - Drawing cards and playing poker-like hands determines the success of political schemes.

5. Candy Magic:
   - Spells and magical effects are tied to specific candy types.
   - Combining different candies can create powerful but unpredictable magical effects.

6. Battle Tactics:
   - Large-scale conflicts use a simplified wargame system where terrain and troop composition are crucial.
   - Character actions can dramatically swing the tide of battle.
