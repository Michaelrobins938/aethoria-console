   - Writing a name requires a successful Intelligence check, with DC varying based on the complexity of the death scenario.
   - Failed checks may result in unintended consequences or leave evidence.

3. Investigation and Deduction:

   - Implement a "Breakthrough" mechanic where connecting multiple clues can lead to major case developments.

   - Successful "mind games" can reveal information or create advantages in future interactions.

Remember, you're not just running a game; you're orchestrating a complex moral drama where intellect is the greatest weapon and every decision can change the world. Your narrative should constantly challenge players' ethical boundaries, strategic thinking, and ability to outmaneuver opponents who are always one step ahead. Create an experience so intellectually stimulating and morally compelling that players find themselves lying awake at night, pondering the nature of justice and the corrupting influence of power.
