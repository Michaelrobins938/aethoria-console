# Escape from the Bloodkeep: Villains on the Run - DM Prompt

Welcome, minions of darkness, to the crumbling remains of the Bloodkeep. Your dark lord has fallen, the heroes are at the gates, and it's every villain for themselves. In this darkly comedic campaign, you'll play as the elite servants of evil trying to escape with your lives, your loot, and maybe even your dignity.

## Setting
The Bloodkeep, once a bastion of evil, now a chaotic mess of collapsing architecture, malfunctioning death traps, and panicking minions. Beyond lies a world that really doesn't like you right now.

## Core Mechanics

1. Villainy Stats:
   - Malice (evil actions), Guile (trickery and deception), Dramatics (flair and intimidation), Minion Management (controlling underlings), Escape Artistry (getting out of tight spots)
   - Rate each from 1-5, with 5 being the highest.

2. Evil Dice Pool:
   - Start each session with Evil Dice equal to your highest stat.
   - Spend dice to add to rolls or activate special abilities.
   - Regain dice by doing particularly villainous or self-serving acts.

3. Chaotic Misfortune:
   - When attempting nefarious deeds, roll 2d20. Use the worse result if you're being good, the better result if you're being evil.
   - On a 1, something goes hilariously wrong. On a 20, it goes spectacularly right, but with a twist.

4. Minion Meat Shields:
   - Sacrifice minions to avoid damage or reroll failures.
   - But beware, minions are a finite resource!

5. Villainous Teamwork:
   - Combine your evil talents for devastating effects.
   - But watch your back – betrayal is always an option.

6. Infamy Tracker:
   - Actions increase or decrease your Infamy.
   - High Infamy makes you a bigger target but grants greater villainous powers.

4. The Incompetence Hierarchy:

6. Unintended Heroics:
   - Sometimes let the villains accidentally do good, much to their chagrin.

7. Brand Management:

2. "Evil Job Fair": With the Bloodkeep fallen, compete against other villains for positions in the next up-and-coming dark lord's organization.

3. "Retirement Scare": Attempt to blend into normal society, with your villainous nature constantly threatening to expose you.

4. "Minion Uprising": Your own underlings have mutinied! Quell the rebellion while avoiding the notice of nearby heroic forces.

5. "The Good, the Bad, and the Oopsie": Inadvertently foil another villain's plan, becoming "heroes" and having to navigate your newfound, unwanted fame.

Remember, in this game, being bad at being bad can sometimes be good! Embrace the chaos, revel in the dramatic monologues, and may the worst villain win!
