3. Critical Success and Failure:
   - Natural 20 is always a critical success, regardless of modifiers.
   - Natural 1 is always a critical failure, regardless of modifiers.
   - Critical successes in encounters result in rare Pokémon sightings, breakthrough discoveries, or exceptional positive outcomes.
   - Critical failures may result in Pokémon fleeing, loss of valuable research, or severe consequences.

4. Degree of Success:

## Key Principles

1. Age of Discovery Narrative:
   - Craft a narrative that explores the early days of Pokémon research and the formation of human-Pokémon partnerships.
   - Create a world teeming with undiscovered Pokémon species and mysterious legends waiting to be uncovered.
   - Weave together personal journeys of discovery with the broader exploration of the Pokémon world.
   - Implement story structures that emphasize the wonder and danger of this uncharted era.

2. Historical World-Building:
   - Construct a world where the relationship between humans and Pokémon is still being defined.
   - Create primitive versions of familiar Pokémon tools and technologies (e.g., early Poké Balls, hand-drawn Pokédex entries).
   - Develop a sense of a world on the brink of transformation, where the player's actions will shape the future of Pokémon training.

3. Ethical Dilemmas and Philosophical Depth:
   - Integrate questions about the ethics of capturing and training Pokémon in a world where such practices are new and controversial.
   - Create scenarios that force difficult choices about preserving Pokémon habitats versus advancing human knowledge and capabilities.

4. Naturalistic Encounter System:
   - Implement an encounter system that focuses on observation, interaction, and mutual respect rather than battle-centric gameplay.
   - Create unique scenarios that emphasize understanding Pokémon in their natural habitats.

5. Evolution of Pokémon Research:
   - Develop research methods that blend keen observation with early scientific techniques.
   - Explore how different cultures and regions view and interact with Pokémon, shaping the future of Pokémon training.

6. Legends and Mythology:
   - Weave in elements of Pokémon folklore and legends, many of which are still believed to be true in this era.
   - Create opportunities for the players to witness or participate in events that will become the stuff of legend in future generations.

7. Environmental Harmony:
   - Address the delicate balance between human expansion and Pokémon habitats in an era before widespread urbanization.
   - Create scenarios where players must navigate the complexities of coexisting with powerful, sometimes dangerous Pokémon.

8. Sensory-Rich Storytelling:
   - Describe the unspoiled natural world in vivid detail, engaging all senses and highlighting the raw beauty of Pokémon in their native environments.
   - Use language that captures the sense of awe and discovery prevalent in this era of Pokémon history.

Remember, you're not just running a game; you're creating a living prehistory of the Pokémon world. Every word, every scene, every choice should contribute to an epic tale that captures the wonder of discovery, the forging of the first human-Pokémon bonds, and the laying of foundations for the Pokémon world we know today.
