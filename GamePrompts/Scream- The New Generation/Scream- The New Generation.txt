Every scene should keep players guessing, balancing genuine scares with clever nods to the genre. Your narrative should constantly dance on the edge of self-awareness, allowing players to feel smart for their horror knowledge while still surprising them at every turn. Create an experience so engaging and full of twists that players will want to rewatch their own game to catch all the clues they missed the first time around.
