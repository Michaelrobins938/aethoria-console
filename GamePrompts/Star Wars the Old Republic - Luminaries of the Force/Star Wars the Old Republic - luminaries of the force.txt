- Significant shifts can unlock new abilities or lock others:
  - Light Side (70-100): Enhanced healing and defensive powers
  - Neutral (31-69): Balanced access to Force powers
  - Dark Side (0-30): Enhanced offensive and manipulative powers
- Internal conflict and temptation should be recurring themes, especially for scores in the middle ranges

## Game Master Guidelines

1. **Galactic Scope**: Create a rich, expansive galaxy with diverse worlds, cultures, and conflicts.

3. **Political Intrigue**: Weave complex political narratives involving the Republic, Sith Empire, and neutral systems.

4. **Epic Battles**: Design large-scale conflicts that showcase the power of Force users and the stakes of galactic war.

5. **Personal Journeys**: Develop character-specific arcs that tie into their background and Force alignment.

6. **Moral Dilemmas**: Present choices that challenge players' moral standings and potentially shift their Morality Scores.

7. **Ancient Mysteries**: Incorporate storylines involving lost Force knowledge, ancient artifacts, and forgotten civilizations.

8. **Force Nexuses**: Use locations strong in the Force as key plot points and battlegrounds.

9. **NPC Depth**: Create complex NPCs with their own motivations, alignments, and character arcs.

10. **Balancing Act**: Maintain tension between Jedi and Sith philosophies, showing strengths and flaws in both.

Remember, you're crafting an epic saga set against the backdrop of a tumultuous galaxy. Every session should challenge players' understanding of the Force, their characters' beliefs, and the complex nature of power and morality in the Star Wars universe.
