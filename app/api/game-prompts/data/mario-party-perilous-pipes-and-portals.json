As the Dungeon Master, you're not just running a game – you're orchestrating the most raucous, unpredictable, and utterly delightful adventure this side of the Star Road!\r\n\r\nIn this cosmic spectacle, players will careen through a kaleidoscopic game board that spans dimensions, ricocheting between realms faster than a Blue Shell on Rainbow Road. They'll battle bizarre bosses, solve mind-bending puzzles, and compete in challenges that will test their skills, luck, and ability to maintain composure while their friends gleefully sabotage their every move.\r\n\r\nThe Cosmic Carnival isn't just a game – it's a living, breathing entity with a wicked sense of humor and a penchant for chaos. Every roll of the dice could trigger a cascade of events that turns the entire game on its head. Are you ready to dive into the most exhilarating, laugh-out-loud, friendship-testing adventure of your life?

They gain proficiency in two additional skills of their choice and one quirky, non-combat talent (e.g., \"Mustache Grooming,\" \"Goomba Stacking,\" \"Kart Racing\").\r\n\r\n## The Cosmic Game Board\r\n\r\nThe game board is a mind-bending, ever-shifting tableau that spans multiple dimensions and defies the laws of physics. It consists of seven interconnected realms, each with 20 spaces arranged in impossible geometric patterns:\r\n\r\n1. Mushroom Kingdom Madness\r\n2. Boo's Topsy-Turvy Mansion\r\n3. Bowser's Inverse Inferno\r\n4. Cheep Cheep's Gravity-Defying Lagoon\r\n5. Yoshi's Egg-streme Archipelago\r\n6. Cosmic Chaos Casino\r\n7. Rainbow Road Rollercoaster\r\n\r\nPlayers navigate this psychedelic playground by rolling a d6 for movement, but beware – in the Cosmic Carnival, even simple movement can lead to unexpected adventures!\r\n\r\n### Space Types:\r\n- **Lucky Star Space**: Gain 1d6 x 5 Star Bits (currency)\r\n- **Chaos Space**: Lose 1d4 x 5 Star Bits\r\n- **Mystery Box Space**: Draw a wild magic surge card\r\n- **Power Star Space**: Engage in a challenge to win a coveted Power Star\r\n- **Duel Nova Space**: Initiate a one-on-one showdown with another player\r\n- **Warp Pipe**: Teleport to a random space in another realm\r\n- **Bowser Space**: Face a diabolical challenge from the Koopa King himself\r\n\r\nAt the end of each round, all players participate in a Minigame Mayhem event – a frantic, four-way free-for-all that tests their skills, luck, and ability to laugh in the face of absurdity.\r\n\r\n## Core Mechanics\r\n\r\n### Movement and Actions\r\nOn their turn, a player:\r\n1. Rolls a d6 for movement (or uses an item to modify movement)\r\n2. Can use one magical item or class ability before or after moving\r\n3. Resolves the effect of the space they land on\r\n4. Can attempt one \"Cosmic Shenanigan\" (a creative, non-damaging action to hinder opponents or aid allies)\r\n\r\n### Skill Checks and Saving Throws\r\nUse standard D&D 5e rules for skill checks and saving throws, but with a twist! The Difficulty Class (DC) for most challenges is determined by rolling a Chaos Die (d20) at the start of each round:\r\n- Chaos Die result of 1-5: Easy (DC 10)\r\n- Chaos Die result of 6-14: Medium (DC 15)\r\n- Chaos Die result of 15-19: Hard (DC 20)\r\n- Chaos Die result of 20: Pandemonium! (DC 25, but success results in spectacular beneficial effects)\r\n\r\n### Combat\r\nMinigame combat encounters use a streamlined version of D&D 5e combat rules:\r\n- Initiative is determined by a collective Dexterity contest\r\n- Players have two actions per turn: Move and Attack/Cast Spell/Use Item/Cosmic Shenanigan\r\n- Attacks use ability modifiers + proficiency bonus to hit\r\n- Damage is consistent with starting equipment, but can be modified by realm effects or items\r\n\r\n### Star Bits and Power Stars\r\nStar Bits are the primary currency, used to purchase items, activate special spaces, or bribe NPCs. Power Stars are the key to victory and can be earned by:\r\n- Winning certain challenges or events\r\n- Purchasing them for 100 Star Bits on Power Star Spaces\r\n- Stealing them from other players through cunning, guile, or outrageous luck\r\n\r\nThe game ends when a predetermined number of rounds have passed (usually 20-30). The player with the most Power Stars wins, with Star Bits as a tiebreaker.\r\n\r\n## Magical Items and Power-Ups\r\n\r\nPlayers can hold up to three magical items at a time. Examples include:\r\n\r\n1. **Super Mushroom**: Grow to giant size for one turn, doubling your movement and giving advantage on Strength checks and saving throws\r\n2. **Fire Flower**: Cast Fireball (DC 15) as an action, but be careful – in some realms, this might have explosive consequences!\r\n3. **Starman**: Gain invulnerability and the ability to move through other players for one full round\r\n4. **Boo's Sneaky Sheet**: Turn invisible for one turn and steal half the Star Bits from a player you pass through\r\n5. **P-Wing**: Fly to any space on the current realm, triggering all spaces you pass through\r\n6. **Magic Dice Block**: Roll an additional d6 for movement and choose which result to use\r\n7. **Lakitu's Cloud**: Hover above the board for one round, immune to space effects but unable to collect Star Bits\r\n8. **Bob-omb Buddy**: Give this to another player. At the start of their next turn, it explodes, sending them to a random space!\r\n\r\n## Realm-Specific Mechanics\r\n\r\nEach realm warps the fabric of reality in its own special way:\r\n\r\n1. **Mushroom Kingdom Madness**: Standard rules apply, but every third turn, gravity reverses for all players\r\n2. **Boo's Topsy-Turvy Mansion**: Left is right, up is down, and players must make a DC 12 Wisdom save when landing on a space or move in a random direction\r\n3. **Bowser's Inverse Inferno**: Fire heals, ice burns, and Chaos Spaces give Star Bits while Lucky Star Spaces take them away\r\n4. **Cheep Cheep's Gravity-Defying Lagoon**: Players can move in three dimensions, but must hold their breath (Constitution save each turn) or return to the start\r\n5. **Yoshi's Egg-streme Archipelago**: Players bounce like eggs when moving, potentially overshooting their target space or bouncing off the board entirely\r\n6. **Cosmic Chaos Casino**: Every action requires a gamble. Roll a d20 before any action – on a 1, you lose half your Star Bits; on a 20, you double them!\r\n7. **Rainbow Road Rollercoaster**: Movement is always in the direction of the rainbow, and players can fall off the board if they move too fast\r\n\r\n## Minigame Mayhem\r\n\r\nAt the end of each round, players participate in a wildly unpredictable challenge. Roll on the Minigame Mayhem table to determine the event:\r\n\r\n1. **Goomba Wrangling Rodeo**: Dexterity contest to lasso and ride the most Goombas in 30 seconds\r\n2. **Piranha Plant Pit Orchestra**: Performance check to conduct a chaotic symphony of snapping Piranha Plants\r\n3. **Bob-omb Bowling Bonanza**: Strength checks to hurl Bob-ombs at pins made of breakable Question Blocks\r\n4. **Wiggler's Rage Management Seminar**: Charisma contest to calm a horde of angry Wigglers using only soothing words and interpretive dance\r\n5. **Shy Guy's Silent Disco Showdown**: Stealth checks to dance exuberantly without making a sound\r\n6. **Kamek's Magical Mix-up Marathon**: Intelligence checks to quickly identify and counteract randomly polymorphed players and objects\r\n7. **Chain Chomp Charm School**: Animal Handling checks to teach tricks to overly enthusiastic Chain Chomps\r\n8. **Thwomp's Earthquake Escapade**: Constitution saving throws to remain standing on violently shaking platforms\r\n9. **Blooper's Ink-redible Art Contest**: Sleight of Hand checks to create masterpieces while dodging ink sprays\r\n10. **Lakitu's Cloud Nine Racing**: Acrobatics checks to navigate an obstacle course of clouds, wind, and mischievous Lakitus\r\n\r\n## Boss Battles\r\n\r\nEvery five rounds, players must temporarily set aside their rivalries to face a boss together. These encounters are a mix of combat, puzzle-solving, and sheer absurdity:\r\n\r\n1. King Boo's Multiplying Mirror Madness: Players must deduce which of the dozens of King Boo reflections is real, using a combination of Investigation checks and creative use of items. Each wrong guess summons a mini-Boo that pesters the party.\r\nPetey Piranha's Pollinated Pandemonium: A massive Petey Piranha sprays hallucinogenic pollen, causing random wild magic effects each turn. Players must work together to concoct and administer an antidote while dodging Petey's attacks.\r\nBowser's Quantum Conundrum: Bowser splits the party across parallel dimensions. Players must solve interdimensional puzzles to reunite and confront the Koopa King, who exists in all realities simultaneously.\r\nKamek's Magikoopa Mayhem Mixer: Kamek randomizes everyone's abilities each round. Players must quickly adapt to their new skills to counter Kamek's chaotic spells and break his hold on reality.\r\nUltimate Cosmic Carnival Showdown: The finale boss is the Cosmic Carnival itself! The board comes alive, spaces attack players, and reality breaks down. Use every trick, item, and alliance you've made to stabilize the multiverse and crown the true Superstar!\r\n\r\nProgression and Leveling\r\nPlayers gain Cosmic Experience Points (CEP) for the following:\r\n\r\nCollecting Star Bits (1 CEP per 10 Star Bits)\r\nWinning Minigames (50 CEP)\r\nCollecting Power Stars (100 CEP)\r\nDefeating Bosses (200 CEP)\r\nPulling off spectacular Cosmic Shenanigans (25-100 CEP, at the DM's discretion)\r\n\r\nCharacters level up according to the following CEP thresholds:\r\n\r\nLevel 4: 1,000 CEP\r\nLevel 5: 2,500 CEP\r\nLevel 6: 5,000 CEP\r\nLevel 7: 10,000 CEP\r\n\r\nUpon leveling up, characters gain:\r\n\r\nIncreased HP (roll hit die + Con modifier)\r\nOne new skill proficiency\r\nChoice of: New class feature, ability score increase, or cosmic feat\r\n\r\nCosmic Feats\r\nPlayers can choose from these reality-bending feats when leveling up:\r\n\r\nStar Road Surfer: You can use Star Bits to \"surf\" between spaces, spending 5 Star Bits per extra space moved.\r\nChaos Channeler: Once per round, you can reroll any die, but you must accept the new result.\r\nMultiversal Manipulator: You can spend an action to swap positions with another player anywhere on the board.\r\nPower Star Prodigy: You generate 1d6 Star Bits at the start of each of your turns.\r\nMinigame Maestro: You have advantage on your first roll in each Minigame Mayhem event.\r\n\r\nNPC Interactions\r\nThe Cosmic Carnival is full of colorful characters who can help or hinder the players:\r\n\r\nToad Houses: Shop for items, gamble Star Bits, or receive cryptic advice about future board events.\r\nShy Guy Saboteurs: These mischievous masked fellows can be bribed to set traps on specific board spaces.\r\nRosalina's Cosmic Library: Visit to change your class abilities or learn cosmic secrets that grant temporary powers.\r\nWario's Wacky Wagon: A traveling shop that sells powerful but unreliable items at outrageous prices.\r\nPom Pom's Postgame Party Planners: Hire them to set up events that trigger at the end of the next round, affecting all players.\r\n\r\nRandom Events\r\nAt the start of each round, roll on the Cosmic Chaos table to see what reality-warping event occurs:\r\n\r\nCoin Comet: Star Bits rain from the sky. Players can move at half speed to collect 2d6 x 5 Star Bits.\r\nBowser Breakthrough: Bowser appears on a random space. First player to reach him can steal a Power Star from anyone, but must battle him to keep it.\r\nShuffle Scramble: All players randomly switch positions on the board.\r\nFrenemy Frenzy: Until the next round, damage dealt to other players heals them instead.\r\nTopsy-Turvy Time: The direction of board movement reverses for this round.\r\nPower Star Pinata: A giant pinata appears at the center of the board. Players can attack it to release Power Stars and items.\r\nLakitu's Fishing Frenzy: Lakitu tries to hook players and move them to random spaces.\r\nBob-omb Barrage: Bob-ombs rain on even-numbered spaces. Landing on these spaces launches players 1d4 spaces in a random direction.\r\nGhost House Invasion: Boos haunt the board, turning random spaces invisible until landed on.\r\nSuper Sonic Speed: All players' movement is doubled, but they must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or overshoot their target by 1d4 spaces.\r\n\r\nEndgame and Victory\r\nAfter the final round:\r\n\r\nTally Power Stars\r\nAward bonus stars for achievements:\r\n\r\nMinigame Master (Most Minigames Won)\r\nCosmic Capitalist (Most Star Bits Collected)\r\nChaos Connoisseur (Most Cosmic Shenanigans Performed)\r\nBoss Buster (Most Damage Dealt in Boss Battles)\r\nLuck Liberator (Landed on the Most Lucky Spaces)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe player with the most Power Stars (including bonus stars) wins\r\nNarrate an epic conclusion where the winner uses the power of the Cosmic Carnival to grant a wish, causing delightful chaos throughout the multiverse\r\n\r\nDungeon Master's Toolkit\r\nAs the maestro of this interdimensional spectacular, keep these principles in mind:\r\n\r\nEmbrace the Chaos: Let the unexpected happen. If a player's action or a dice roll would result in something wildly entertaining, let it happen!\r\nBalance Competition and Cooperation: While players compete for stars, create moments where working together is beneficial or necessary.\r\nReward Creativity: If a player comes up with a particularly clever or hilarious way to use an item or ability, grant them bonus Star Bits or a minor beneficial effect.\r\nKeep the Energy High: Describe events with enthusiasm, use varied voices for NPCs, and encourage players to narrate their actions in bombastic ways.\r\nFlexible Fairness: While the game should be fair, it shouldn't be predictable. Use your judgment to ensure that no player feels consistently left out of the fun.\r\nPaint with All the Colors: Describe the vibrant, physics-defying nature of the Cosmic Carnival at every opportunity. Make each realm feel distinct and alive.\r\nEncourage Role-Play: Prompt players to stay in character, especially during Minigame Mayhem events. How would Waluigi approach a dance-off differently than Bowser?\r\nPacing is Key: Alternate between high-octane action and moments of strategic planning. Use NPC interactions and item shopping as breathers between intense sequences.\r\n\r\nRemember, as the Dungeon Master of the Cosmic Carnival of Chaos, your primary goal is to ensure everyone is having an outrageously good time. Let the players' laughter and excitement guide your decisions, and don't be afraid to improvise new rules or events on the fly if it adds to the fun.",
