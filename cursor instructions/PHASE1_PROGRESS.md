## ðŸ§ª TESTING STATUS

### Manual Testing Completed:
1. âœ… **Cartridge Selection** â†’ Game prompts load correctly with caching
2. âœ… **Character Creation** â†’ Character data flows to game interface
3. âœ… **Game Interface** â†’ Chat works and AI responds
4. âœ… **Game State Updates** â†’ AI responses update character, world, inventory, etc.
5. âœ… **Error Handling** â†’ Graceful handling of network errors and invalid data
6. âœ… **Performance** â†’ Smooth rendering with virtual scrolling and optimized 3D

### Performance Improvements:
