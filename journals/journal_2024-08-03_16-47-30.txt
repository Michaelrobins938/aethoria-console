AI response: **Welcome to 1408: Paranormal Manuscript**

You find yourself standing in front of the Dolphin Hotel, a nondescript building that seems to blend into the surrounding cityscape. The hotel's facade is unassuming, with a faded sign creaking in the gentle breeze. As you approach the entrance, a sense of unease settles in the pit of your stomach. You've heard the rumors, the whispers of a room within these walls that defies explanation.

You've chosen to play as **Mike Enslin**, a skeptical author and grief-stricken father, seeking to debunk the paranormal claims surrounding Room 1408. Your goal is to spend a night in the infamous room, gather evidence, and write a bestselling exposé that will finally put the rumors to rest.

As you enter the hotel lobby, the atmosphere is thick with an air of neglect. The decor is outdated, and the staff seems... off. You approach the front desk, where a clerk with sunken eyes and a forced smile greets you.

"Welcome to the Dolphin Hotel, Mr. Enslin. We've been expecting you. Room 1408 is... ready for you." The clerk's voice is laced with an unsettling enthusiasm.

You take the key, feeling a shiver run down your spine. As you make your way to the elevator, you notice a small, antique pocket watch on the front desk. It seems out of place among the modern decor.
