AI response: **The Dolphin Hotel, Room 1408**

You stand before the Dolphin Hotel, a nondescript building that seems to blend into the cityscape. Yet, this unassuming hotel holds a dark secret: Room 1408, a place where the fabric of reality is said to be twisted and distorted. As a writer investigating paranormal claims, you've insisted on staying in this infamous room, despite the warnings from the hotel staff.

You've chosen to play as **Mike Enslin**, a skeptical author and grief-stricken father, still reeling from the loss of your daughter. Your goal is to uncover the truth behind Room 1408, while also searching for proof of the afterlife.

As you enter the hotel lobby, the atmosphere is thick with an eerie sense of unease. The staff seems reluctant to engage with you, their eyes darting nervously towards the elevator. You notice a small, antique key on the reception desk, labeled "1408."

The receptionist, a pale woman with sunken eyes, hands you the key. "Room 1408," she says, her voice barely above a whisper. "Be careful. Some guests... never check out."

You take the key, feeling a shiver run down your spine. The elevator doors slide open, revealing a dimly lit interior. You step inside, and the doors close behind you with a soft whoosh.

AI response: **The Elevator Lurches to a Stop**

As you focus on your research, the elevator suddenly jolts to a stop on a floor that doesn't seem to be listed on the display. The lights flicker, and the air is charged with an electric sense of anticipation. The doors slide open, revealing a narrow, dimly lit corridor that seems to stretch on forever.

The atmosphere in the corridor is heavy with the scent of old books and decay. You can feel a strange, pulsating energy emanating from the walls, as if the very fabric of reality is distorted here. The air seems to vibrate with an otherworldly presence, making your skin crawl.

**A Hidden Path Revealed**

As you step out of the elevator, you notice that the corridor is lined with old, leather-bound books. The tomes seem to be stacked haphazardly, as if they've been thrown together in a hurry. The books appear to be bound in a strange, scaly material that seems to shift and writhe in the dim light.

The corridor stretches out before you, disappearing into the darkness. You can feel a strange pull, as if something is drawing you deeper into the heart of the hotel. The air seems to grow colder, and you can see your breath misting in front of you.

**Your Current Status:**

* Sanity Meter: 90 (-10 due to the sudden, unexplained disturbance)
* Emotional Intensity: 60 (+10 due to the eerie atmosphere)
* Time: 10:05 PM (though the hotel's clocks seem to be stuck in a perpetual loop)

AI response: **The Ancient Artifact**

As you scan the shelves, your eyes land on a peculiar object that seems out of place among the dusty tomes. It's an ancient artifact, its surface etched with strange symbols that appear to shift and writhe like living serpents. The object itself is small, about the size of a pocket watch, and is made of a dark, glass-like material that seems to absorb the light around it.

As you reach out to touch the artifact, you feel a sudden jolt of energy, like a spark of electricity has been transmitted through your body. The symbols on the surface begin to glow with a faint, otherworldly light, and you can feel a strange, pulsating power emanating from the object.

**The Artifact's Power**

As you hold the artifact, you start to feel a creeping sense of dread. The symbols on the surface seem to be shifting, rearranging themselves into a new pattern. You can feel a power building inside the artifact, a power that seems to be growing stronger by the second.

Suddenly, the artifact emits a blinding flash of light, and you feel yourself being pulled into a vision. You see a room, similar to the one you're in now, but with a different occupant. A woman, dressed in old-fashioned clothing, sits at a desk, scribbling furiously in a journal. She looks up, and her eyes lock onto yours.

**The Woman's Message**

The woman's eyes seem to bore into your soul, and you feel a shiver run down your spine. She speaks, her voice barely above a whisper, but the words echo in your mind.

"Find the truth," she says. "The room is not what it seems. The hotel is a prison, and the guests are the prisoners. You must uncover the secrets of Room 1408 before it's too late."

The vision fades, and you're left standing in the corridor, the artifact still clutched in your hand. You feel a sense of unease, as if the artifact has awakened a power within you that you can't quite control.

**Your Current Status:**

* Sanity Meter: 80 (-10 due to the artifact's power)
* Emotional Intensity: 70 (+10 due to the artifact's influence)
* Time: 10:10 PM (though the hotel's clocks seem to be stuck in a perpetual loop)
* Location: Hidden Corridor, Floor Unknown

User input: I need to find the elevator 
AI response: **The Distress Signal**

As you try to find the elevator, a sudden distress signal pierces the air, echoing off the walls of the corridor. The signal is loud and insistent, and you can feel a sense of urgency emanating from it. The sound seems to be coming from a nearby abandoned structure, a crumbling building that appears to have been left to decay.

**Your Options:**

A) Investigate the source of the distress signal
B) Ignore the signal and continue searching for the elevator
C) Try to find a way to disable the signal
D) Call out for help, hoping someone will respond

**Your Current Status:**

* Sanity Meter: 80
* Emotional Intensity: 70
* Time: 10:10 PM (though the hotel's clocks seem to be stuck in a perpetual loop)
* Location: Hidden Corridor, Floor Unknown

**Consequences of Your Choice:**

If you choose to investigate the source of the distress signal, you may find clues to the hotel's dark past or encounter other survivors who can aid or hinder your progress. However, you risk being drawn into a new danger or becoming trapped in the abandoned structure.

If you choose to ignore the signal, you may be able to find the elevator more quickly, but you'll be leaving behind a potential source of information or assistance.

If you choose to try to disable the signal, you may be able to silence the noise, but you risk triggering a new danger or alerting unknown entities to your presence.

If you choose to call out for help, you may attract the attention of allies or enemies, but you risk being overheard by the hotel's sinister forces.
