AI response: **Star Wars: Echoes of the Force - Old Republic RPG**

**Introduction**

In a distant corner of the galaxy, 1,000 years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Old Republic and the Sith Empire are embroiled in a bitter conflict that has spanned centuries. The war-torn galaxy is a complex tapestry of allegiances, rivalries, and ancient secrets waiting to be uncovered.

You are a Force-sensitive individual, drawn into this epic struggle by fate, circumstance, or personal choice. Your journey begins on the planet of Taris, a bustling hub of commerce and innovation that has been a focal point of the conflict. The planet's dense urban landscape is a maze of towering skyscrapers, underworld hideaways, and ancient ruins.

As you navigate the city-world, you are approached by a mysterious figure who has been searching for individuals with your particular... talents. They introduce themselves as Rennan Vex, a charismatic information broker with connections to the Jedi Order.

**Your Mission**

Rennan Vex has learned of a powerful Sith artifact hidden deep within the Sith-occupied planet of Korriban. This relic, known as the "Eye of the Dark Lord," is said to grant immense power to its wielder. Vex believes that the Jedi Council would be very interested in acquiring this artifact, and he needs your help to retrieve it.

**Your Starting Point**

You find yourself in a seedy cantina on the lower levels of Taris. The air is thick with smoke and the hum of conversation. Rennan Vex sits across from you, a data pad on the table between you.

"Listen, I know this is a lot to take in," Vex says, "but time is short. I have reason to believe that a Sith Lord, Darth Syrus, is also seeking the Eye of the Dark Lord. If he gets his hands on it... well, let's just say the galaxy will become a very dark place."

Vex hands you a data pad with information on Korriban and the Eye of the Dark Lord. "You'll need to be careful. The Sith Empire is not to be underestimated."

**Your Current Status**

* You are on Taris, in the cantina.
* You have the data pad with information on Korriban and the Eye of the Dark Lord.
* You have a connection to Rennan Vex, who can provide you with further assistance.
* You
