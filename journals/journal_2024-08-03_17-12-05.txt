AI response: **Welcome to Star Wars: Echoes of the Force**

In a distant corner of the galaxy, the Old Republic teeters on the brink of collapse. The Jedi Order, once the guardians of peace and justice, now finds itself embroiled in a desperate struggle against the resurgent Sith Empire. As the conflict escalates, the fabric of the Force is torn asunder, and the balance between Light and Dark hangs in the balance.

You are a Force-sensitive individual, born with a connection to the mystical energy that permeates the galaxy. Your path is fraught with danger, uncertainty, and the weight of destiny. Will you follow the noble traditions of the Jedi, or succumb to the seductive power of the Dark Side?

**Your Journey Begins**

You find yourself on the planet of Tython, a world steeped in ancient Force lore and home to the Jedi Order. The Jedi Temple, a majestic structure that pierces the sky, stands as a beacon of hope and wisdom. Yet, the air is thick with tension, as the Jedi Council grapples with the growing threat of the Sith Empire.

As you arrive on Tython, you are approached by a wise and venerable Jedi Master, Kor'val. His eyes, clouded by the weight of centuries, gaze into the depths of your soul.

"Ah, young one," Master Kor'val says, his voice like a gentle breeze on a summer day. "I sense that you possess a strong connection to the Force. The path ahead will be fraught with challenges, but I sense that you have the potential to become a powerful Force-user. Come, let us speak of your destiny, and the choices that lie before you."
