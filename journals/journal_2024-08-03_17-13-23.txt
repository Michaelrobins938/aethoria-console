AI response: **The Stage is Set**

Welcome to **Star Wars: Echoes of the Force**, a role-playing game set 1,000 years in the past during the Old Republic era. You are a powerful Force user, destined to play a key role in the ongoing conflict between the Jedi and Sith.

The galaxy is at a critical juncture. The Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order have been weakened by centuries of internal strife and external threats. The Sith Empire, once a fledgling power, has risen to become a formidable foe. Its Dark Lords, driven by ambition and a desire for dominance, seek to destroy all who stand in their way.

**Your Story Begins**

You find yourself on the planet **Ryloth**, a world on the edge of the Outer Rim. This desert planet, home to the nomadic Twi'lek people, is a place of contrasts – where sandy dunes and canyons give way to massive cave cities.

Your past is shrouded in mystery. Some memories haunt you, while others remain shrouded in a Force-fog. One thing is clear, however: you have a crucial role to play in the struggle to come.

As you navigate this treacherous landscape, you must navigate your own relationship with the Force. The boundaries between light and darkness are about to be tested. The echoes of the past whisper warnings, hinting at ancient powers stirring from the shadows.

**Your Journey**

You've arrived on Ryloth with a few fragments of your past:

1. You recall training on a Jedi temple ship as a Padawan, though details of your master or mission are fuzzy.
2. You have skills related to survival in the Outer Rim and negotiation with diverse cultures.
3. A whisper of your last memories hint at an assassination attempt by the Sith – your reactions may still hold hidden connections.

Now, on this alien world, rumors abound:

- Ryloth is becoming increasingly hostile toward offworlders. Its citizens suspect conspiracies within their midst, amidst unrest about planetary allegiances to the Republic and concerns of possible Sith interference.

As a fresh breeze rustles your clothing and desert creatures seek refuge, an underlying anxiety starts spreading within your own veins... questions clamoring about an awakening sensation haunting within – though very specifically remaining below or veiling close potential information access threshold where strong relation emerge related topic role deeper emotion intensity itself awakening fully about heart even against logical ones completely sealed free mental waves clear stronger perception leading reaching senses echo being
