**Your Equipment:**

* The Shepherd's Journal (a cryptic journal that contains clues to the location of Atlantis)
* Magnifying Glass
* Satchel of Maps and Notes

**Your Goal:**

Your goal is to decipher the clues in the Shepherd's Journal and use them to find the lost city of Atlantis. You will need to use your linguistic skills to translate ancient texts, and your cartographic skills to navigate the treacherous underwater terrain.

**You are currently on the submarine Ulysses, heading towards the location indicated by the Shepherd's Journal.**

As you look around the submarine, you see the other members of the expedition team busy with their preparations. Vinny Santorini, the demolitions expert, is checking the explosives and equipment. Audrey Ramirez, the mechanic, is tinkering with the submarine's engines. Dr. Joshua Sweet, the medical officer, is checking the medical supplies.

Suddenly, the submarine's captain, Preston B. Whitmore, enters the room. "We're approaching the location indicated by the Shepherd's Journal," he says. "Prepare for descent."

The submarine begins to dive, and you feel a sense of excitement and trepidation. What do you do?

A) Start deciphering the clues in the Shepherd's Journal
B) Check the submarine's equipment and supplies
C) Talk to the other members of the expedition team
D) Go to the control room to observe the descent

Please respond with the letter of your chosen action.
AI response: **An Enigmatic Message Appears on Your Communications Device**

As you're busy preparing for the descent, your communications device beeps, signaling an incoming message. You glance at the screen, and your eyes widen in surprise. The message is cryptic and doesn't seem to be from anyone on the expedition team.

**The Message Reads:**

"Turn back now. The city is not what you think. The cost of discovery is too high. -A friend"

The message is unsigned, and there's no indication of who sent it or how they managed to contact you. You feel a shiver run down your spine as you wonder who could have sent this message and what they might be trying to warn you about.

**Your Thoughts:**

You start to think about the implications of this message. Could it be a prank from someone on the team? Or is it a genuine warning from someone who knows more about the city than you do? You start to feel a sense of unease, wondering if you're really prepared for what lies ahead.

**Your Options:**

A) Ignore the message and continue with the expedition
B) Show the message to the rest of the team and discuss its implications
C) Try to respond to the message and ask for more information
D) Report the message to Captain Whitmore and ask for his guidance

Please respond with the letter of your chosen action.

(Note: As the Game Master, I'll use this opportunity to introduce a new plot thread and create tension within the team. Your response will determine how the story unfolds from here.)
AI response: **A Mysterious Stranger Approaches You**

As you're pondering the cryptic message, a mysterious stranger approaches you. They're dressed in a long, black coat with a wide-brimmed hat, and their face is obscured by a veil of shadows. They move with an air of confidence and purpose, and you can't help but feel a sense of intrigue.

"Excuse me, Mr. Thatch," the stranger says in a low, gravelly voice. "I couldn't help but notice your interest in the lost city of Atlantis. I have information that might be of great value to you."

The stranger hands you a small, leather-bound book. The cover is worn and cracked, but the pages within are filled with intricate diagrams and cryptic notes.

"This is a journal from one of the earliest explorers to venture into the city," the stranger explains. "It contains clues to the city's layout, its secrets, and its dangers. But be warned, Mr. Thatch, the city is not for the faint of heart. You will need all your wits and cunning to survive."

The stranger pauses, studying you intently. "I'm willing to part with this journal for a price. Are you interested?"

**Your Thoughts:**

You're torn between your desire for knowledge and your skepticism about the stranger's motives. The journal could be a valuable resource, but you don't know if you can trust the stranger. You also wonder what kind of price the stranger might be asking.

**Your Options:**

A) Accept the journal and ask about the price
B) Refuse the journal and try to gather more information about the stranger
C) Attempt to negotiate the price or offer a trade
D) Report the stranger to Captain Whitmore and ask for his guidance

Please respond with the letter of your chosen action.

(Note: As the Game Master, I'll use this opportunity to introduce a new plot thread and create tension within the team. Your response will determine how the story unfolds from here.)

**Roll a Wisdom (Insight) check to see if you can sense any ulterior motives from the stranger.**

Roll a d20 and add your Wisdom modifier (+3 in your case) to the roll. If the total equals or exceeds 15, you sense that the stranger might be hiding something.
