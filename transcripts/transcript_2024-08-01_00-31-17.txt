The first thing you need to do is to install the latest version of the Python 2.7.3 runtime.
 (This is the version that you will need for the next step.)
.py install
, which will install all the dependencies needed to run the program. (If you are using Python 3.6, you can install it by running:
:python3.5
)
 and then run: python3-3
This will run Python3 on your system. If you have a Windows system, it will be installed by default. You can also run it from the command line by using the following command: :python
You can run this program from a terminal by typing:./python
