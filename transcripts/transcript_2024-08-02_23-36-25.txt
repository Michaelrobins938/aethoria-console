AI: As Alex Loomis, the tech-savvy outsider, you bring a unique set of skills to the table. Your paranoid preparedness and hacking abilities will undoubtedly come in handy as you navigate the treacherous landscape of Woodsboro.

Let's get started! You find yourself in the midst of a bustling school day at Woodsboro High. The anniversary of the original Ghostface killings is just around the corner, and the town is on edge. You've been noticing strange occurrences around town, from eerie messages on social media to whispered rumors of a new killer on the loose.

As you walk down the hallway, you overhear a group of students discussing the recent murder of a local teenager. The police are stumped, and the town is in a state of panic. You notice that the group seems particularly interested in the fact that the victim was an avid horror movie fan, and that the killer left a cryptic message at the crime scene: "You can't escape the rules."

You have three options to respond to the situation:

A) Approach the group and share your own theories about the murder, using your knowledge of horror tropes to try and make sense of the cryptic message.

B) Slip away unnoticed, deciding to investigate the crime scene and gather more information on your own.

C) Take out your phone and start hacking into the school's security systems, trying to uncover any potential surveillance footage or clues that might have been missed.
