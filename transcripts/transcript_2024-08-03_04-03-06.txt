AI: **Groovy Choice!**

You are Ash Williams, the legendary Deadite Slayer, Reluctant Hero, and S-Mart Employee. You've been drawn to the cursed town of Springwood, near the infamous Crystal Lake, by visions of impending doom. Your trusty Boomstick and Chainsaw Hand are at the ready.

As you arrive in Springwood, you notice a sense of unease in the air. The locals are whispering about strange occurrences and gruesome murders. You've got a feeling that Freddy Krueger, the dream demon, is involved. Your mission is to uncover the source of the evil and put an end to it.

**Your Current Stats:**

* Charisma: 16 (+3)
* Dexterity: 15 (+2)
* Constitution: 14 (+2)
* Combat Aptitudes: Boomstick Mastery, Chainsaw Proficiency, Deadite Lore
* Special Trait: Groovy Comeback (can turn critical failures into unexpected successes)
* Equipment: "Boomstick" (Double-barrel shotgun), Chainsaw Hand, Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (partial)

**Your First Objective:**

You've received a tip that a local archeological dig has uncovered an ancient Sumerian artifact, which might be the source of the evil. The dig site is located on the outskirts of Springwood, near the Crystal Lake. You need to investigate the site, gather information, and put a stop to whatever evil is brewing.

As you approach the dig site, you notice that the atmosphere is tense. The workers are on edge, and the air is thick with an eerie, unnatural silence. You see a group of workers huddled around a large, ancient-looking artifact. Suddenly, one of them lets out a blood-curdling scream.

**Combat Encounter:**

A group of 4 Deadites, summoned by the artifact, emerge from the shadows. They're fast, agile, and hungry for flesh.

* Deadite 1: HP 10, AC 12
* Deadite 2: HP 10, AC 12
* Deadite 3: HP 10, AC 12
* Deadite 4: HP 10, AC 12

**Your Turn:**

What do you do?

A) Unleash a barrage of Boomstick shots
B) Rev up your Chainsaw Hand and charge into melee
C) Try to reason with the Deadites (good luck with that
