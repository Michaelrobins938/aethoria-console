AI: It seems like you're ready to begin the game. Let's get started!

As the DM, I'll set the scene and guide you through the story. You'll make choices and take actions, and I'll respond with the consequences of those actions.

You find yourself in modern-day Japan, where a mysterious notebook with the power to kill has fallen into human hands. The world is about to change dramatically as those who possess the Death Note grapple with its power, while others race to uncover the truth behind unexplained deaths.

You've chosen to play as Ryuki Tanaka, the Conflicted Savior. You're a brilliant law student who's found the Death Note, and you're initially using it to pursue justice. However, you're struggling with the morality of your actions.

You're currently in your small apartment, surrounded by books and notes on law and criminology. You've been using the Death Note to kill off high-profile criminals, but you're starting to feel the weight of your actions.

As you sit at your desk, staring at the Death Note, you receive a message from an unknown number:

"Meet me at the old warehouse on 5th and Main at midnight. Come alone."

The message is cryptic, but it seems like someone knows about your activities as Kira.

What do you do?

A) Ignore the message and continue using the Death Note to kill off more criminals.
B) Investigate the old warehouse and see who's behind the message.
C) Bring a friend or ally to the meeting, just in case.
D) Use the Death Note to try and gather more information about the mysterious sender.
