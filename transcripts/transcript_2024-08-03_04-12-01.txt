AI: It seems like you're ready to start your adventure in Stardew Valley! Let's get started.

As we begin, you find yourself standing in front of your grandfather's old farm, which has been neglected for many years. The farm is located in a beautiful valley surrounded by rolling hills and dense forests. The air is fresh, and the sound of birds chirping fills the air.

You've just inherited the farm from your grandfather, who passed away recently. You've decided to leave your old life behind and start fresh in this peaceful valley. Your goal is to restore the farm to its former glory and make a new life for yourself.

As you look around, you notice that the farm is in a state of disrepair. The fields are overgrown with weeds, and the farmhouse is in need of renovation. However, you can see the potential for this farm to be a thriving and beautiful place.

You have three starting farmer types to choose from:

1. The Green Thumb
2. The Animal Whisperer
3. The Crafty Explorer

Which type of farmer would you like to be?

Please respond with the number of your chosen farmer type.
