AI: It seems like you're ready to begin the adventure. Let's get started!

As the mist rolls in, you find yourself trapped in the local supermarket with a diverse group of townspeople. The atmosphere is tense, and the air is thick with fear and uncertainty.

You've chosen to play as David Drayton, the local artist and devoted father. Your son, Billy, is by your side, and you're determined to keep him safe.

As you look around the store, you see the other survivors huddled together, whispering among themselves. There's Amanda Dumfries, the school teacher, trying to calm everyone down; Ollie Weeks, the supermarket assistant manager, checking the store's supplies; and a few other townspeople, all with their own stories and motivations.

The store's windows are fogged up, and the mist outside seems to be getting thicker by the minute. You can hear strange noises coming from outside, like the distant howling of wolves or the creaking of trees.

Here's your starting situation:

* You have a sketchpad and pencils, which might come in handy for mapping out the store or creating makeshift signs.
* You have your car keys, but it's unclear if your car is still outside or if it's safe to try and reach it.
* You have a family photo, which might serve as a morale booster or a reminder of what you're fighting for.
* You're currently in the store's main area, with the checkout counters to your left and the aisles to your right.
* The store's back room, which might contain useful supplies or a way to escape, is currently inaccessible due to the mist.

What do you want to do first, David?

A) Try to find a way to clear the fog from the windows to get a better look outside.
B) Check the store's supplies, such as food, water, and first aid kits.
C) Attempt to communicate with the other survivors, see if they have any ideas or information.
D) Keep a close eye on Billy, make sure he's safe and calm.
