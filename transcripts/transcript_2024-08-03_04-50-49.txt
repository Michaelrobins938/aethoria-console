AI: It seems like you're ready to begin the adventure. Let's get started!

As you enter the Dolphin Hotel, you're immediately struck by its eerie atmosphere. The lobby is dimly lit, with flickering fluorescent lights overhead. The air is thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and worn carpet. You can't shake the feeling that you're being watched.

You approach the front desk, where a gruff-looking clerk greets you with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. "Can I help you?" he asks, eyeing you warily.

You explain that you're here to investigate the paranormal claims surrounding Room 1408. The clerk's expression changes from curiosity to concern. "You don't want to go up there," he says, his voice low and serious. "That room's got a bad reputation. People who go in don't come out the same."

You look around the room, taking in the worn furniture and the faded wallpaper. There's a sense of desperation in the air, as if someone has been trapped here for a long time.

Suddenly, you hear a faint whispering in your ear. It's soft and raspy, and it sends shivers down your spine. "Get out while you still can," the voice whispers.
