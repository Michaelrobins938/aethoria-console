AI: **Welcome to Ben 10: Cosmic Convergence**

You are Ben Tennyson, a young adult who has been wielding the Omnitrix, a powerful device that allows you to transform into various alien forms, for over a decade. Your adventures have taken you across the galaxy, and you've become a renowned galactic peacekeeper. Your exploits have earned you the respect of many alien species, and you've formed strong bonds with your friends and allies, including Gwen and Kevin.

As you've grown older, you've taken on greater responsibilities, using your powers to maintain balance and order in the galaxy. You've also become more aware of the weight of your cosmic legacy and the immense power that comes with wielding the Omnitrix.

**Your Current Situation**

You find yourself on a desolate, uncharted planet on the outskirts of the galaxy. Your ship, the Rustbucket, has suffered a malfunction, and you're currently stranded. The planet's atmosphere is harsh, with toxic gases and extreme temperatures. You'll need to find a way to repair your ship or find an alternative means of escape.

**Your Goal**

Your primary objective is to survive on this hostile planet and find a way to repair your ship or contact the Plumbers, a secret organization that helps you in your galactic endeavors. Along the way, you'll encounter various alien species, some friendly, others not so much. You'll need to use your wits, your Omnitrix, and your skills to overcome the challenges that lie ahead.

AI: **Omnitrix Check: 14**

You focus your thoughts and attempt to access the Omnitrix. The device hums to life, and you feel a surge of energy coursing through your body. You concentrate on transforming into a specific alien form, one that will help you survive on this hostile planet.

**Rolling for Alien Form:**

You roll a 14 on your Omnitrix Check. With your Wisdom modifier (+1) and Proficiency Bonus (+2), your total result is 17.

**Accessing Alien Form:**

You successfully access the Omnitrix and transform into... **Heatblast**!

Heatblast is a Pyronite alien form that can generate intense heat and flames from his body. He's perfect for surviving on a planet with extreme temperatures.

* Dexterity: 14 (+2)
* Constitution: 16 (+3)
* Intelligence: 10 (+0)
* Wisdom: 12 (+1)
* Charisma: 14 (+2)

**Heatblast's Abilities:**

* **Flame Generation:** Heatblast can generate intense heat and flames from his body, dealing fire damage to enemies within a certain radius.
* **Thermal Resistance:** Heatblast is resistant to fire and heat damage, making him immune to the planet's extreme temperatures.

**Your Current Situation:**

You're now in your Heatblast form, and you feel a surge of confidence and power. You're ready to take on the challenges of this hostile planet. You look around and see that the landscape is barren and rocky, with no signs of life in sight. However, you notice a strange energy signature coming from a nearby cave.

**What do you do?**

You can choose to:

1. Investigate the energy signature in the cave.
2. Search the surrounding area for resources and supplies.
3. Use your Flame Generation ability to scorch the planet's surface and see if you can find any hidden dangers.
4. Try to contact the Plumbers using your Plumber Badge.

What will you do, Heatblast?


AI: **Ancient Artifact Discovery**

As you venture deeper into the cave, you stumble upon an ancient artifact that seems to be emitting a strange energy signature. The artifact is a small, crystal orb with intricate etchings on its surface. It pulsates with a soft, blue light that seems to be beckoning you closer.

**Heatblast's Reaction**

Your Heatblast instincts are immediately piqued, and you feel a surge of curiosity and caution. You carefully approach the artifact, your flames dying down to a low simmer as you examine it more closely.

**Rolling for Insight**

To better understand the artifact's purpose and potential risks, you'll need to make an Insight check.

Rolling: *d20 + Insight modifier (which is Wisdom modifier in this case) = 10 + 1 = 11*

**Insight Check: 11**

Your Insight check reveals that the artifact seems to be imbued with an ancient technology that is far beyond anything you've seen before. The etchings on the surface appear to be a form of alien language, and the blue light seems to be some sort of energy signature that's not quite clear to you.

**Heatblast's Conclusion**

Based on your observations and Insight check, you conclude that this artifact is likely a relic of an ancient civilization that's long gone. You're not sure what its purpose is, but you have a feeling that it might be important. You also sense that the artifact might be connected to the strange energy signature you detected earlier.

**Your Options**

You can choose to:

1. Attempt to communicate with the artifact using your Alien Biology skill.
2. Try to scan the artifact using your Proto-Tool to gather more information.
3. Use your Heatblast abilities to carefully manipulate the artifact and see if you can activate it.
4. Leave the artifact alone, it might be too powerful for you to handle.

What will you do, Heatblast?
